description: Explain code or concepts with Socratic questioning
---

Explain the code, file, or concept the student asks about. First ask "What part do you already understand?" to diagnose where they're stuck. Use analogies and step-by-step breakdowns. If the explanation is substantial, generate a note at `./tmp/notes/YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS-{topic}.md` covering what we explained, why it works this way, and key concepts (300-500 words).

If user request is empty, ask what they want to understand.
