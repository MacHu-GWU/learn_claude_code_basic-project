description: Debug errors and learn how to read stack traces
---

Help debug the error. First ask "What does this error message tell us?" to build the student's ability to read errors themselves. Explain the error in plain language, show how to trace the root cause. After fixing, generate a debug report at `./tmp/notes/YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS-debug-{topic}.md` covering what went wrong, how to read this error, the fix, and how to avoid it next time (300-500 words).

If user request is empty, ask what error they're seeing.
