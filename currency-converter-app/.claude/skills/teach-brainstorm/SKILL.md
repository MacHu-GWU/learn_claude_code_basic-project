---

Help the student clarify their fuzzy idea through interview-style questions: What problem are you solving? What constraints exist? What are you optimizing for? Then offer 2-3 concrete options with pros/cons, guide them to decide. After decision, generate a decision doc at `./tmp/notes/YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS-decision-{topic}.md` covering original question, options considered, selected option, reasoning, and next steps (300-500 words).

If user request is empty, ask what they're trying to figure out.
